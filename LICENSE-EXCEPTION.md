# Licensing notes for UASFlightPlan

UASFlightPlan is licensed under the **[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or
later](LICENSE)** (AGPL-3.0-or-later).

Two things about an ATAK plugin do not follow from the license text alone, and
both are stated here so nobody has to guess: the additional permission that lets
this plugin be combined with ATAK, and which files in this repository TAKWERX did
not write.

---

## 1. Additional permission for the TAK Software — AGPL-3.0 §7

An ATAK plugin is loaded into ATAK's own process and calls ATAK's API directly.
That is what a plugin is, and the AGPL was not written with it in mind, so the
permission below is granted explicitly.

> **Additional permission under GNU AGPL version 3 section 7**
>
> As a special exception, the copyright holders of UASFlightPlan give you permission to
> combine, link with, and distribute UASFlightPlan, or a work based on UASFlightPlan, together
> with the TAK Software — ATAK-CIV, ATAK-GOV, ATAK-MIL and the TAK Software
> Development Kit, as licensed by the United States Government under the TAK
> Software License Agreement — and to convey the resulting work.
>
> You must still comply with the GNU AGPL in all respects for the portions of the
> resulting work that are UASFlightPlan, or a work based on UASFlightPlan.
>
> If you modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the
> file, but you are not obliged to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this
> exception statement from your version.

**In plain English.** You can build this plugin against the TAK SDK, sideload it
into ATAK, and hand the result to whoever you like, without anyone claiming the
AGPL reaches into ATAK. What stays covered is this plugin's own source: modify it
and pass it on, and the people you pass it to are owed that source under the same
license.

**If you only install and use UASFlightPlan, none of this touches you.** Running the
plugin, in any agency, on any number of devices, triggers no obligation at all.

**This exception does not come from the Government, and does not change the TAK
Software License Agreement.** It is TAKWERX removing a restriction its own
license would otherwise impose. The TAK Software remains under its own terms, and
the SDK's §6 grant is what makes this repository possible in the first place:

> "you are granted a perpetual, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free right to
> use the TAK-SDK and to derive new works or applications based on the TAK-SDK"

The same clause forbids copying, publishing or distributing the SDK, so no SDK
binary is in this repository and none ever will be. `main.jar`, `atak.apk`,
`atak-gradle-takdev.jar` and the shared development keystore are supplied by the
SDK you download yourself, and are reached through a `local.properties` that is
not tracked here.

## 2. Provenance — files TAKWERX did not write

A plugin is scaffolded from the TAK-SDK's `plugintemplate` sample, so parts of
this repository originate with the TAK Product Center rather than with TAKWERX.
Those parts remain subject to the TAK Software License Agreement, and the AGPL
grant above covers only TAKWERX's own work. Where the two meet in one file, the
AGPL applies to the modifications.

**From the TAK-SDK `plugintemplate` sample**, essentially unchanged:

- `app/src/main/java/com/atakmap/android/uasflightplan/plugin/PluginNativeLoader.java`
  (identical to the template but for the package name)
- `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, `gradle.properties`, `gradle/versions.gradle`
- `app/build.gradle` and `app/proguard-gradle.txt` — template files with a plugin's
  own version, target and keep rules edited in
- `template.local.properties`
- the `com.atakmap.app.component` declaration in `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

**Derived from the template and substantially rewritten** — AGPL applies to the
changes:

- `app/src/main/java/com/atakmap/android/uasflightplan/plugin/UASFlightPlan.java`

**Third party:**

- `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat` and `gradle/wrapper/` — Gradle Inc., Apache License 2.0
- any data the plugin downloads or ships is published by the agency that owns
  it, named in the plugin and in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Agency
  records are not TAKWERX's work and are not covered by the AGPL grant.

Everything else under `app/src/main/java/`, `app/src/main/res/`, `tools/` and
`docs/` is TAKWERX's own work and is AGPL-3.0-or-later.

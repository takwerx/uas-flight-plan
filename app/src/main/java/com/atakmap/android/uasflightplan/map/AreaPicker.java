/**
 * Picking an area of interest: run ATAK's own polygon drawing tool, then take the
 * shape it made as the area.
 *
 * <h3>Why not our own two taps</h3>
 *
 * The first version listened for two {@code MAP_CLICK}s and drew nothing in between,
 * so the operator tapped twice into empty space with no sign either tap had landed and
 * no idea what shape was coming. Their words: "im not seeing my taps in the corners it
 * needs to be like using the polygon tool". They are right, and the answer is not to
 * reinvent the feedback — ATAK already has a shape tool with the rubber band, the
 * vertex handles, the prompt, the undo and the tap-the-first-marker-to-close that an
 * ATAK user has already learned.
 *
 * <p>A rectangle came first and the operator replaced it: "i think this is better than
 * square". They are right again — a division or a contingency line is not a box, and
 * a box drawn round an irregular piece of ground claims ground nobody asked about.
 *
 * <p>The pattern is FOBS's {@code FreehandTrack}, which drives ATAK's telestration tool
 * the same way: snapshot what exists, start the tool, wait for it to end, take what is
 * new. Two details from FOBS are load-bearing and are why this is not obvious:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The tool's buttons live on ATAK's <b>drawing toolbar</b>, so the toolbar has to
 * be opened first.</li>
 * <li>{@code SET_TOOLBAR} is a <b>broadcast</b>, delivered after the calling method
 * returns, and its handler ends whatever tool is active. Start the tool in the same
 * breath and ATAK ends it immediately — FOBS lost a day to exactly that on
 * 2026-09-05. Hence the delay before starting.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The shape stays on the map once its bounds are taken. It is the boundary of the
 * area, and it is the only thing on screen while the overlay is computing or switched
 * off.
